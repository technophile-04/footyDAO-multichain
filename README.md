## Blockchain Contracts and Interoperability

- Base FootyDAO Contract - Optimism Goerli: Optimism : [Address](https://goerli-optimism.etherscan.io/address/0xA63184B6e04EF4f9D516feaF6Df65dF602B07a13)
### Chainlink CCIP transactions - Interoperability 
- Arbitrum Goerli , Mumbai , Base Goerli  ->  Optimism Goerli : [CCIP LINK](https://ccip.chain.link/address/0xA63184B6e04EF4f9D516feaF6Df65dF602B07a13) Check "incoming"
### Chainlink Functions: Manage FAN token distribution on the Chiliz network : 
- Showcased [here](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x7043dfb5db32ef820d0bb23e6f168c94e8be8fb2)
  
   - üìÅ --> call `demoDistribute(:address)` and you will get some FAN tokens minted on chiliz network through functions.

## Technology Stack
- Chainlink CCIP and Functions
- Chiliz Fan Tokens
- IPFS
- API3
- Worldcoin
- Unlimit

## Technical Note

For developers, a small tweak is needed in the Chainlink CCIP contracts to avoid interface clashes. 
Modify the CCIPReceiver.sol in the ` node_modules/@chainlink/contracts-ccip/src/v0.8/ccip/applications/ directory as follows:

```solidity
  function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public pure virtual override returns (bool) {
    return interfaceId == type(IAny2EVMMessageReceiver).interfaceId || interfaceId == type(IERC165).interfaceId;
  }
```
